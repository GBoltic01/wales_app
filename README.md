# Active Travel Network Development Tool for Wales

This simple project was created as my first dab into the web programming world- it is a result of my passion for GIS and programming.  

Project is a simple one page app with the map (focused on Wales) being in the center of it all. There is a side panel on a left hand side where all current functionality is placed.
The idea behind the project was to create an interactive webmap, where user can look for different datasets that are relevant when planning walking and cycling networks across local authorities.

In addition to these datasets, I added a basic 'A to B' routing machine. Developing the routing functionality is also the next priority for this project. The anticipated result should have an option for the user to set a number of different origin points and one destination point, all of which the user can specify on the map. Different travel modes will (hopefully) be supported as well.
Wish me luck!

## Screenshots of the webmap 

As the app is still in development and hasn't been deployed yet, I added a few screengrabs below, to show current progress.

This is the first screen a user will see when opening the app.

User has to select local authority from the dropdown menu first. When that happens, extent of the map will focus and higlight that local authority. Then a user can expand collapsible menu on the left to see all the datasets that are available.

Legend of the selected datasets will appear at the bottom of the sidepanel in a scrollable div.

User can add routing functionality, specifying origin and destination points on the map. For example in this case, we want to find the optimal route from the area with high population density to the one with high concentration of jobs, since this link could potentially generate high number of commute trips if safe cycling infrastructure is introduced.
